                <description>THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS... FOR THE LAST TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moon will soon return. Whether this heralds the destruction of
                    humankind or something worse will depend on two women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essun has inherited the power of Alabaster Tenring. With it, she hopes to find her
                    daughter Nassun and forge a world in which every orogene child can grow up safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nassun, her mother's mastery of the Obelisk Gate
                    comes too late. She has seen the evil of the world, and accepted what her mother will not admit: that sometimes what is corrupt cannot be cleansed, only
                    destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The remarkable conclusion to the post-apocalyptic and highly acclaimed trilogy that began with the
                    multi-award-nominated &lt;i&gt;The Fifth Season.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

                <description>This is the way the world ends... for the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The season of endings grows darker as civilization fades into the long cold
                    night. Alabaster Tenring – madman, world-crusher, savior – has returned with a mission: to train his successor, Essun, and thus seal the fate of the Stillness
                    forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It continues with a lost daughter, found by the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It continues with the obelisks, and an ancient
                    mystery converging on answers at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stillness is the wall which stands against the flow of tradition, the spark of hope long
                    buried under the thickening ashfall. And it will not be broken.

                    TERRIFYING PROPHETIC NOVEL OF A POST-LITERATURE FUTURE...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of
                    commodities, the source of all discord and unhappiness: the printed book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montag never questions the destruction or his own bland life,
                    until he is shown a past where people didn’t live in fear and a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of
                    television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montag begins to question everything he has ever known and starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is
                    discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classic novel of a post-literate future, Fahrenheit 451 stands alongside Orwell's
                    1984 and Huxley's Brave New World as prophetic account of Western civilization's enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradbury's
                    powerful and poetic prose combines with uncanny insight into the potential of technology to create a classic of twentieth-century literature which over fifty
                    years from first publication, still has the power to dazzle and shock.

                <description>Clarke's masterful evocation of the far future of humanity, considered his finest novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men had built cities before, but never
                    such a city as Diaspar. For millennia its protective dome shut out the creeping decay and danger of the world outside. Once, it held powers that rule the stars.&lt;br
                    /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, as legend has it, the invaders came, driving humanity into this last refuge. It takes one man, a Unique, to break through Diaspar's
                    stifling inertia, to smash the legend and discover the true nature of the Invaders.

                <![CDATA[<i>The City and the Stars</i> is a classic 50's Sci-Fi novel, with a very interesting premise - the last humans on Earth have isolated themselves in a great city and are afraid of leaving it. The book tackles many themes and ideas, has a likable if not very developed main character and is surprisingly not dated. Clarke's clear and concise language was like a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The pace slackens a bit in the middle but overall it was a great read.]]>

                <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the way the world ends... for the last time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with the great red rift across the heart of
                    the world's sole continent, spewing ash that blots out the sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with death, with a murdered son and a missing daughter. &lt;br
                    /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with betrayal, and long dormant wounds rising up to fester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Stillness, a land long familiar with
                    catastrophe, where the power of the earth is wielded as a weapon. And where there is no mercy.

                <description>&lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a distant future, where humans are forced to submit their wills to the requirements of the state, under the rule
                    of the all-powerful Benefactor, and dreams are regarded as a sign of mental illness. In a city of straight lines, protected by green walls and a glass dome, a
                    spaceship is being built in order to spearhead the conquest of new planets. Its chief engineer, a man called D-503, keeps a journal of his life and activities:
                    to his mathematical mind everything seems to make sense and proceed as it should, until a chance encounter with a woman threatens to shatter the very
                    foundations of the world he lives in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in a highly charged, direct and concise style, Zamyatin’s 1921 seminal novel – here
                    presented in Hugh Aplin’s crisp translation – is not only an indictment of the Soviet Russia of his time and a precursor of the works of Orwell and the
                    dystopian genre, but also a prefiguration of much of twentieth-century history and a harbinger of the ominous future that may still lay ahead of us.

                <![CDATA[Surprisingly modern for a book written in 1921. Told as a series of journal entries written by a mathematician, <i>We</i> follows Delta-503's life after a chance encounter with a woman that threatens to shatter the very foundations of the world he lives in (the blurb says it best).<br /><br />There are a lot of ideas and themes, brilliantly executed here, that will later resurface in other dystopian works. I expected to be a bit bored with the obvious freedom is good and "unfreedom" is bad parts, but they were done in a unique way, so no complaints there.<br /><br />The prose, though, was not my favourite ever. It can be incoherent; there's plenty of sawed-off sentences and dialogue that leaves the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. I get and appreciate that the style perfectly reflects the main character's turmoil and confused thoughts, but that doesn't make it a joy or easy to read.<br /><br />Also, fantastic cover art.]]>

                <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the
                    year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life
                    couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that: &lt;br /&gt;(1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien
                    forces &lt;br /&gt;(2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations &lt;br /&gt;(3)
                    at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on
                    avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding
                    of what the starship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt; really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.

                <![CDATA[So meta.<br /><br />I expected to find a plot that's OK at best, sprinkled with jokes about expendable crew members. While Scalzi certainly delivers in the humor department, he also crafts a cool and imaginative story, with a very likable central cast of characters. Animatedly, you don't get to know a great deal about them, but I think that factors in with the tropes the author is playing with. <br /><br />But it's not just play. Besides making fun of said tropes, like needlessly killing off characters (before the commercial brake, for MAXIMUM DRAMATIC EFFECT), illogical plotlines and plot armor, there's emotion and even a message in there. <i>Redshirts</i> is the richer for it.<br /><br />The codas I could happily ignore, as I was very satisfied where and how the story ended; they're completely different in tone to the rest of the book and unnecessary in my opinion.]]>

                <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and
                    is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods:
                    witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to
                    harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe's place of exile, entwining
                    their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
                    /&gt;There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe's independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe
                    must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

                <![CDATA[Absolutely beautiful, I was hooked from the first page.<br /><br />Following Circe's journey was a treat, her struggles being surprisingly relatable and modern. I loved how she crossed paths with other figures from mythology, be they mere mortals, heroes or gods. <br /><br />The way the story balances Circe's more intimate surroundings and actions with the complicated, cruel and punishing world of the gods was really well done - she is constrained by the latter and must always take into account the consequences of her decisions; although she does this, there are quite a few missteps along the way. But it's only more satisfying when she gets it right.<br /><br />This was an absolute joy to read, and it opened my appetite for more. I can't wait to get my hands on Miller's <i>The Song of Achilles</i> as well as Dan Simmon's<i>Ilium</i> and<i>Olympos</i>.]]>

                <description>The ancient menace has finally escaped from Lalonde, shattering the Confederation's peaceful existence. Those who succumbed to it have acquired godlike
                    powers, but now follow a far from divine gospel as they advance inexorably from world to world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On planets and asteroids, individuals
                    battle for survival against the strange and brutal forces unleashed upon the universe. Governments teeter on the brink of anarchy, the Conferderation Navy is
                    dangerously over-stretched, and a dark messiah prepares to invoke his own version of the final Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In such desperate times the last
                    thing the galaxy needs is a new and terrifyingly powerful weapon. Yet Dr Alkad Mzu is determined to retrieve the Alchemist - so she can complete her thirty-year
                    vendetta to slay a star. Which means Joshua Calvert has to find Dr. Mzu and bring her back before the alchemist can be reactivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But
                    he's not alone in the chase, and there are people on both sides who have their own ideas about how to use the ultimate doomsday device.

                <description>In AD 2600, the human race is finally beginning to realize its full potential. Hundreds of colonized planets scattered across the galaxy host a
                    multitude of prosperous and wildly diverse cultures. Genetic engineering has pushed evolution far beyond nature's boundaries, defeating disease and producing
                    extraordinary spaceborn creatures. Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive on the wealth created by the industrialization of entire star systems. And
                    throughout inhabited space the Confederation Navy keeps the peace. A true golden age is within our grasp. But now something has gone catastrophically wrong. On
                    a primitive colony planet a renegade criminal's chance encounter with an utterly alien entity unleashes the most primal of all our fears. An extinct race, which
                    inhabited the galaxy aeons ago called it

                <![CDATA[Disclaimer: I'm a sucker for Hamilton's door-stoppers, so it's easier for me to gloss over their faults.<br /><br />As was the case with the Commonwealth series and Great North Road, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's strengths: fascinating world-building, thrilling action and a huge cast of mostly interesting characters to follow (there's no list for this one, so taking notes proved very useful).<br /><br />One thing has me worried though, and it's the baddies. They started out firmly in the Sci-Fi realm and then went into Fantasy or something of the like. I'm really curios where it all leads to, and I hope the sequels will provide an answer that I'll like :)<br /><br />Overall, a great start to the series. Only about 2400 pages to go...]]>

                <description>The burgeoning new economies in near-Earth space are fuelled by a steady stream of comets, steered back home by huge nuclear-powered mining ships like
                    Bella Lind's Rockhopper. Bella and her crew are desperate for some much-needed R&amp;amp;R - until Janus, one of Saturn's ice moons, inexplicably leaves its
                    natural orbit.

                <description>Set within a system of decaying world-ships travelling through deep space, this breakout novel of epic science fiction follows a pair of sisters who
                    must wrest control of their war-torn legion of worlds—and may have to destroy everything they know in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the outer rim
                    of the universe, a galactic war has been waged for centuries upon hundreds of world-ships. But these worlds will continue to die through decay and constant war
                    unless a desperate plan succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anat, leader of the Katazyrna world-ship and the most fearsome raiding force on the Outer Rim, wants
                    peace. To do so she offers the hand of her daughter, Jayd, to her rival. Jayd has dreamed about leading her mother’s armies to victory her whole life—but she
                    has a unique ability, and that makes her leverage, not a leader. As Anat convinces her to spend the rest of her life wed to her family’s greatest enemy, it is
                    up to Jayd’s sister Zan—with no stomach for war—to lead the cast off warriors she has banded together to victory and rescue Jayd. But the war does not go at all
                    as planned…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Fall of Hyperion&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Stars are Legion&lt;/i&gt;
                    is an epic and thrilling tale about familial love, revenge, and war as imagined by one of the genre’s most imaginative new writers.

                <![CDATA[I think I kept reading because I had a HUGE amount of questions. There were no answers. <br /><br />Another reviewer asked "What the heck is a cephalopod gun?". Surely a silly example out of a myriad of more important ones, but I too would like an answer :)<br /><br />The worldbuilding is indeed creative, and I was intrigued at first, but when two characters depart their spaceship straddling bio-mechanical vehicles (space-horses, basically) which shoot yellow vapour from their behinds, all the while communicating with each other <b>using sign language</b> I started asking myself some questions. "What?!?" being the most prevalent.<br /><br />I was genuinely curios how the Legion came to be, the nature of the worlds they inhabited, how large are they, how gravity works there, what's the point of the thin atmosphere if nobody lives on the surface, how the internal levels were actually devised and so on. I had a hard time imagining these levels, as the images the author paints are not very revealing and sometimes confusing. <br /><br />The main character has amnesia and you spend a great length of the book in the dark, following her and a few others in a boring journey to the top of the world, set piece to set piece. Remarkably little mystery is revealed throughout this journey and when it hits, I was long passed the point of caring. <br /><br />During this journey a character almost dies, but is ultimately saved by a spirit. That only she can see. It's never explained of touched upon again. "What?!?".<br /><br />Oh yeah, about the inexistence of men in this novel, as in not even mentioned. I don't care as long as it's explained (which it isn't), although it does feel a bit shallow. Is it supposed to be refreshing? Feminist? Just because it's an all woman cast it's a good thing? If I'm reading early Sci-Fi that has shit women characters (so much cringe there), does that mean that the reverse is OK? I really liked how the author played with genders in the other novel of hers that I've read, <i>The Light Brigade</i>, where the main character could be read as either male or female. Implying that gender doesn't matter seems to me a better message than whatever the absence of men was meant to be.<br /><br />While <i>The Stars Are Legion</i> has some good parts, they are massively overshadowed by its faults. Would not recommend.]]>

                <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Hugo Award­­–winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Stars Are Legion &lt;/i&gt;comes a brand-new science fiction thriller about a futuristic
                    war during which soldiers are broken down into light in order to get them to the front lines on Mars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They said the
                    war would turn us into light. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;I wanted to be counted among the heroes who gave us this better world. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br
                    /&gt;The Light Brigade: it’s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars call the ones who come back…different. Grunts in the corporate corps get busted down
                    into light to travel to and from interplanetary battlefronts. Everyone is changed by what the corps must do in order to break them down into light. Those who
                    survive learn to stick to the mission brief—no matter what actually happens during combat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dietz, a fresh recruit in the infantry,
                    begins to experience combat drops that don’t sync up with the platoon’s. And Dietz’s bad drops tell a story of the war that’s not at all what the corporate
                    brass want the soldiers to think is going on.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is Dietz really experiencing the war differently, or is it combat madness? Trying to
                    untangle memory from mission brief and survive with sanity intact, Dietz is ready to become a hero—or maybe a villain; in war it’s hard to tell the difference.&lt;br
                    /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A worthy successor to classic stories like &lt;i&gt;Downbelow Station&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt; The
                    Forever War&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; The Light Brigade&lt;/i&gt; is award-winning author Kameron Hurley’s gritty time-bending take on the future of war.

                <![CDATA[The book starts with Dietz, a native of Brazil, joining the military out of a sense of duty, after a catastrophic event that killed people in the millions. Sound familiar? At this point I was a bit worried, as I was basically reading <i>Starship Troopers</i>.<br /><br />But then Dietz goes on the first combat drop and things go in a wild and unexpected direction, both for Dietz and the reader :)<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the strengths of <i>The Light Brigade</i> without spoiling the fun of discovering them yourselves. But I will say that you get a piece of the puzzle revealed in every chapter, which makes it very exciting and hard to put down; it's well written, fast paced and never boring. Besides war, it also addresses current issues like climate change, corporate greed, the control of information and others.<br /><br />And it's the first Mil SciFi where I wasn't bored with all the combat descriptions!<br /><br />Excellent read.]]>

                <description>Set in the days of civilization's collapse, &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic
                    group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One snowy night a
                    famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt;. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to
                    dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling
                    Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the
                    actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a
                    dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.

                    to die for the very last time ...Chief Scientist Gadfium is about to receive the mysterious message she has been waiting for from the Plain of Sliding Stones
                    ...And Bascule the Teller, in search of an ant, is about to enter the chaos of the crypt ...And everything is about to change ...For this is the time of the
                    encroachment and, although the dimming sun still shines on the vast, towering walls of Serehfa Fastness, the end is close at hand. The King knows it, his
                    closest advisers know it, yet sill they prosecute the war against the clan Engineers with increasing savagery. The crypt knows it too; so an emissary has been
                    sent, an emissary who holds the key to all their futures.

                <![CDATA[Some parts are beautifully written, others very hard to read. The "progris riports" from <i>Flowers for Algernon</i> were a breeze to go through compared to Bascule's chapters. Although story-wise, they were among the most compelling.<br /><br />Definitely weird, and not 100% enjoyable. But an OK novel overall.]]>

                <description>It is 4034 AD. Humanity has made it to the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of, Fassin Taak must
                    travel amongst the Dwellers of the gas giant Nasqueron, in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. Any help they offer will be on their own terms
                    and in their own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But time is one thing Fassin Taak doesn't have, with each passing day bringing the system closer to war - a war
                    that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[Straight to the favourites shelve. <br /><br /><i>The Algebraist</i> has all the hallmarks of excellent space opera: great world-building and characters, mystery, fascinating concepts, exciting plot, interesting aliens, lots of reveals and (in this case especially) humour.<br /><br />What I liked most about this novel though are the Dwellers. They're an ancient, galaxy-spanning species of aliens that live inside the atmosphere of gas giants. They have a very laissez-faire attitude towards events outside their homeworlds or indeed the whole Milky Way; they're quirky, secretive, deceptive and not at all easy to deal with. It's a joy to see them interact with the human characters of the book, and often hilarious as well.<br /><br />Lost some sleep to this one.<br />5/5.]]>

                <description>&lt;b&gt;Civilization rests on the backs of its outcasts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;So when civilization
                    needs someone to run generating stations three kilometers below the surface of the Pacific, it seeks out a special sort of person for its Rifters program. It
                    recruits those whose histories have preadapted them to dangerous environments, people so used to broken bodies and chronic stress that life on the edge of an
                    undersea volcano would actually be a step up. Nobody worries too much about job satisfaction; if you haven't spent a lifetime learning the futility of fighting
                    back, you wouldn't be a rifter in the first place. It's a small price to keep the lights going, back on shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are things among
                    the cliffs and trenches of the Juan de Fuca Ridge that no one expected to find, and enough pressure can forge the most obedient career-victim into something
                    made of iron. At first, not even the rifters know what they have in them--and by the time anyone else finds out, the outcast and the downtrodden have their
                    hands on a kill switch for the whole damn planet...

                <![CDATA[<b>Very</b> dark.<br /><br />While it mostly explores the psychology of some very fucked up characters, it also delves into AI, genetic engineering, deep sea life and evolution.<br /><br />As is the case with the more recent <i>Blindsight</i>, the novel is pretty uneven. There's no plot for the first two thirds of the book - but that's OK, because reading about dysfunctional people living on the bottom of the ocean is surprisingly gripping. The trouble is that when said plot starts, it feels a bit rushed.<br /><br />Issues notwithstanding, Peter Watts has a unique style of tackling some heavy themes, and that alone makes <i>Starfish</i> a worthwhile read.]]>

                <description>The worldwide bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/i&gt; by Orson Scott Card comes to the screen at last in a major motion picture event in November
                    2013. Starring Hugo's Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, and Ben Kingsley, the movie is sure to inspire a new audience of fans to read the book that started it
                    all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Earth is under attack. An alien species is poised for a final assault. The survival of humanity depends on a military
                    genius who can defeat the aliens. But who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ender Wiggin. Brilliant. Ruthless. Cunning. A tactical and strategic master. And a child.&lt;br
                    /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recruited for military training by the world government, Ender's childhood ends the moment he enters his new home: Battle School. Among the
                    elite recruits Ender proves himself to be a genius among geniuses. He excels in simulated war games. But is the pressure and loneliness taking its toll on
                    Ender? Simulations are one thing. How will Ender perform in real combat conditions? After all, Battle School is just a game. Isn't it?
